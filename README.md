##### **In this portfolio there are several projects from assignments regarding data science and machine learning when I attended Purwadhika's class. most of the datasets are obtained from [kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/) site and are of CSV type because the projects that I work on as areas exercise and as a simulation reference when in the real industry so that they seem realistic. Here are the projects :** 


#### 1.  Hotel Booking Demands 
- is a supervised machine learning (classification) project which makes a prediction model that a customer will cancel after booking a hotel room
- source data : [Click This](https://www.kaggle.com/jessemostipak/hotel-booking-demand/data)
- For details of the process, such as coding, insight, and others you can find this jupyter notebook file --> [hotel_booking](https://github.com/rasyadmustafa/Data-Science_Project_Rasyad/blob/main/hotel_booking.ipynb)
- here is the dataset --> [hotel_bookings dataset](https://github.com/rasyadmustafa/Data-Science_Project_Rasyad/blob/main/hotel_bookings.csv)



#### 2.  Bank Marketing Campaigns 
- is a supervised machine learning (classification) project that makes a predictive model as to whether a customer will join this bank's service product. This project is my final project with my friend while in purwadhika
- source data : [Click This](https://www.kaggle.com/volodymyrgavrysh/bank-marketing-campaigns-dataset)
- For details of the process, such as coding, insight, and others you can find this jupyter notebook file --> [marketing_campaigns](https://github.com/rasyadmustafa/Data-Science_Project_Rasyad/blob/main/final_project.ipynb)
- here is the dataset --> [marketing campaigns dataset](https://github.com/rasyadmustafa/Data-Science_Project_Rasyad/blob/main/bank-additional-full.csv)



#### 3.  Housing Price 
- is a supervised learning (regression) that makes a predictive model of an average housing price in the California area and in this project uses the ensemble model method
- source data : [Click This](https://www.kaggle.com/camnugent/california-housing-prices)
- For details of the process, such as coding, insight, and others you can find this jupyter notebook file --> [housing_price](https://github.com/rasyadmustafa/Data-Science_Project_Rasyad/blob/main/lat1_ensemble%20model.ipynb)
- here is the dataset --> [housing price dataset](https://github.com/rasyadmustafa/Data-Science_Project_Rasyad/blob/main/housing.csv)




#### 4.  Clustering  
- is unsupervised learning (clustering) which creates a clustering model from the California housing dataset based on the features in it. The output of this model is to get a group from a segmentation
- source data : [Click This](https://www.kaggle.com/camnugent/california-housing-prices)
- For details of the process, such as coding, insight, and others you can find this jupyter notebook file --> [clustering](https://github.com/rasyadmustafa/Data-Science_Project_Rasyad/blob/main/K-means%20(housing).ipynb)
- here is the dataset --> [clustering](https://github.com/rasyadmustafa/Data-Science_Project_Rasyad/blob/main/housing.csv)



#### 4.  NLP  
- is an NLP method which processes a string of data type. in this project do a word search that often appears from the title course udemy
- source data : [Click This](https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/udemy-courses)
- For details of the process, such as coding, insight, and others you can find this jupyter notebook file --> [NLP](https://github.com/rasyadmustafa/Data-Science_Project_Rasyad/blob/main/Udemy%20Courses%20-%20Text%20Mining.ipynb)
- here is the dataset --> [NLP](https://github.com/rasyadmustafa/Data-Science_Project_Rasyad/blob/main/udemy_courses.csv)



#### 5.  Time Series  
- In this project, we are working on a time series that estimates the total volume of avocados for the next few years in America
- source data : [Click This](https://www.kaggle.com/timmate/avocado-prices-2020)
- For details of the process, such as coding, insight, and others you can find this jupyter notebook file --> [time series](https://github.com/rasyadmustafa/Data-Science_Project_Rasyad/blob/main/Udemy%20Courses%20-%20Text%20Mining.ipynb)
- here is the dataset --> [time series](https://github.com/rasyadmustafa/Data-Science_Project_Rasyad/blob/main/avocado.csv)




#### 6.  Recomended System  
- In this project, we recommend unread books by customers based on the book rating 
- source data : [Click This](https://www.kaggle.com/bahramjannesarr/goodreads-book-datasets-10m)
- For details of the process, such as coding, insight, and others you can find this jupyter notebook file --> [recomended system](https://github.com/rasyadmustafa/Data-Science_Project_Rasyad/blob/main/lat2_recommend_sys.ipynb)
- here is the dataset --> [books dataset](https://github.com/rasyadmustafa/Data-Science_Project_Rasyad/blob/main/book1-100k.csv) & [ratings dataset](https://github.com/rasyadmustafa/Data-Science_Project_Rasyad/blob/main/user_rating_0_to_1000.csv)




#### 7.  SQL (PyMySQL)
- This project is different from others not about machine learning but about SQL. This project is actually one of the tests when I was in Purwadhika, which is about understanding SQL with MYSQL. in the test i did it through jupyter notebook using python MySQL and the database used is sakila, the database about DVD rental shop.
- source database : [Click This](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/sakila/en/)
- For details of the process, such as coding, insight, and others you can find this jupyter notebook file --> [Module 2 Exam](https://github.com/rasyadmustafa/Data-Science_Project_Rasyad/blob/main/ujian_module2.ipynb)
- here is the sakila database --> [sakila](https://github.com/rasyadmustafa/Data-Science_Project_Rasyad/blob/main/sakila.mwb)
