## **Rasyad_DS_Porto**

##### **In this portfolio there are several projects from assignments regarding data science and machine learning when I attended Purwadhika's class. most of the datasets are obtained from [kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/) site and are of CSV type because the projects that I work on as areas exercise and as a simulation reference when in the real industry so that they seem realistic. Here are the projects :** 


> #### 1.  Hotel Booking Demands 
- is a supervised machine learning (classification) project which makes a prediction model that a customer will cancel after booking a hotel room
